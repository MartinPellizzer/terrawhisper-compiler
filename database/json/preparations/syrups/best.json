    "intro": "Syrups are concentrated herbal preparations made by dissolving plant materials in a sweetened liquid, typically water or alcohol. They are commonly used in herbalism to make medicinal compounds more palatable and easier to consume. Syrups often contain extracts of herbs such as echinacea, licorice, or ginger, which are valued for their therapeutic properties. They are frequently used to treat respiratory conditions, soothe sore throats, and support immune health. In traditional herbal practices, syrups are also used to deliver nutrients and active compounds in a form that is gentle on the digestive system.",
