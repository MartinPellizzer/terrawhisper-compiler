    "title": "What to know about teas for medicinal use?",
    "intro": "Teas are a traditional herbal preparation made by steeping plant materials such as leaves, flowers, roots, or berries in hot water. This method extracts the active compounds from the herbs, creating a soothing and easily consumable form of medicine. In herbalism, teas are used to support various health conditions, including digestive issues, stress relief, and immune support. They are often customized based on the individual's needs and the properties of the herbs used. Teas remain a popular and accessible way to incorporate herbal remedies into daily wellness practices.",
    "best": "Some of the best herbal teas for medicinal purposes are Zingiber officinale, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Ginkgo biloba, Lavandula angustifolia, and Echinacea purpurea. Zingiber officinale, or ginger, is prized for its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits. Glycyrrhiza glabra, or licorice root, supports respiratory health and soothes sore throats. Ginkgo biloba enhances cognitive function and improves blood circulation. Lavandula angustifolia, or lavender, promotes relaxation and alleviates anxiety. Echinacea purpurea is well-known for its immune-boosting properties and ability to reduce the duration of colds.",
    "what": "Teas are herbal preparations made by steeping dried plant parts, such as leaves, flowers, roots, or berries, in hot water. Unlike tinctures, which use alcohol as a solvent, or capsules, which encase powdered herbs in a protective shell, teas are consumed as a liquid, allowing for a more direct and gentle interaction with the body. This method of preparation often preserves the natural compounds of the herbs, making it a popular choice for those seeking a mild and accessible form of herbal medicine. Teas are also easier to customize, as they can be flavored and combined with other herbs to suit individual needs. Compared to other preparations, teas offer a simpler, more affordable, and more versatile option for incorporating herbal benefits into daily life.",
    "how_it_works": "Teas work by using heat and water to extract bioactive compounds from plant materials through a process called infusion, where soluble components dissolve into the liquid. The solubility of various phytochemicals in water depends on their molecular structure, and heat increases the kinetic energy of molecules, facilitating the release of active constituents. Commonly extracted compounds include polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and volatile oils, which contribute to the tea\u2019s therapeutic effects. These compounds are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and delivered to systemic circulation, where they interact with biological targets to exert their pharmacological actions. The potency of the tea depends on factors such as brewing time, temperature, and the type of plant used."
